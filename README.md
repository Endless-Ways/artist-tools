# Artist tools for Endless Ways

## testing-room
Sample setup for testing a p5.js project in Endless Ways. Designed for use with Visual Studio Code using the Live Server extension by Ritwick Day. 

To use:
1. Clone this repository or download as a zip.
2. Launch Visual Studio Code, File -> Open Folder... and open the `artist-tools` folder you just downloaded.
3. If you haven't already, go the Extensions panel in Visual Studio Code and install the Live Server extension by Ritwick Day.
4. Click the "Go Live" button on the bottom edge of the Visual Studio Code window - you'll find it somewhere near the bottom right hand corner. 
5. On the browser window that opens up, click the `testing-room` link that appears to open up the example project.
6. Press space to generate a new token seed.

If you make changes to the files in the `testing-room` folder, when you save them the browser window automatically reloads. You can also make your own copy of the `testing-room` folder and use it to develop and test your own artwork.
